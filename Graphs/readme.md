## CSC320 Final Programming Exam
## Due Tuesday, December end-of-day

>NOTE: This is a closed internet and closed communication exam. The consequences of violating the Academic Honesty policy is that you will at least receive a 0 on the exam and you might fail the course. This is true whether you were the one who got help from someone in the class or you were the one providing the help. If you help someone (as well intentioned as you are), it is the equivalent of handing someone your test so that they can copy the answers.

#### You may NOT:
- Do not discuss this (any aspect of it!) with anyone - not a classmate, a tutor, a friend, and not your mother. Treat it as if you were in the room taking a test.
- Do not look up anything on the internet related to writing code for Graphs - no YouTube, no StackOverflow, no GeeksForGeeks, NOTHING!!!
- Do not YouTube anything.
- Do not use code written by anyone else.

#### You MAY:
- Ask Dr. Larson questions. I will answer only clarifying or general questions. Any answers that are given will be broadcast to the class (I will not reveal who asked the question).
- Use Java documentation for data structures - there are many used in these algorithms.
- Use the textbook.

> PHONE A FRIEND (well, ME!). I will provide to each student 1 debug session (not longer than 10 minutes). This will be a debug session only. I will not provide guidance on how to write or design the solution during this time. You can request this at any time. You are likely to encounter NullPointer exceptions. Try to track down your bugs using print statements or the debugger, but if you are stuck, schedule a session. 


#### Deliverables

Your deliverables include the following:
- Comment the code provided.
- Comment the code you write.
- Complete the algorithm for DFS.
- Complete the algorithm for Dijkstra.
- Create a disjoint test graph for BFS and DFS (meaning not everything is connected). It must have at least 12 vertices. It can be directed or undirected. Trace the results and make sure it works!
- Readme

Make sure your code compiles! If it isn't compiling, comment out the part that is causing problems. Report that in your Readme.

#### Readme

- For both DFS and Dijkstra, report on how you tested your code.
- For both DFS and Dijkstra, report if it is a) compiling, b) executing, c) correct.
- For any bugs in your code, comment on what you think is the problem.
- List any resources that you used other than the textbook.
